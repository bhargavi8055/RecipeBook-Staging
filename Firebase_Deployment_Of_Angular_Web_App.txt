You're about to initialize a Firebase project in this directory:

  F:\Bhargavi\Projects\RecipeBook-Staging-main\RecipeBook-Staging-main

Before we get started, keep in mind:

  * You are initializing within an existing Firebase project directory

? Are you ready to proceed? Yes
? Which Firebase features do you want to set up for this directory? Press Space to select features, then Enter to confirm your choices. Hosting: Configure files for Firebase Hosting and (optionally) set up GitHub Action deploys

=== Project Setup

First, let's associate this project directory with a Firebase project.
You can create multiple project aliases by running firebase use --add,
but for now we'll just set up a default project.

i  Using project recipebook-cab87 (RecipeBook)

=== Hosting Setup

Your public directory is the folder (relative to your project directory) that
will contain Hosting assets to be uploaded with firebase deploy. If you
have a build process for your assets, use your build's output directory.

? What do you want to use as your public directory? dist/recipe-book-angular
? Configure as a single-page app (rewrite all urls to /index.html)? Yes
? Set up automatic builds and deploys with GitHub? No
? File dist/recipe-book-angular/index.html already exists. Overwrite? No
i  Skipping write of dist/recipe-book-angular/index.html

i  Writing configuration info to firebase.json...
i  Writing project information to .firebaserc...

+  Firebase initialization complete!

F:\Bhargavi\Projects\RecipeBook-Staging-main\RecipeBook-Staging-main>firebase deploy

=== Deploying to 'recipebook-cab87'...

i  deploying hosting
i  hosting[recipebook-cab87]: beginning deploy...
i  hosting[recipebook-cab87]: found 13 files in dist/recipe-book-angular
+  hosting[recipebook-cab87]: file upload complete
i  hosting[recipebook-cab87]: finalizing version...
+  hosting[recipebook-cab87]: version finalized
i  hosting[recipebook-cab87]: releasing new version...
